<h1> The Best Words</h1>
<div class="block1">
<div class="Peter">Come Talk To Me</div>
<div class="text">
The wretched desert takes its form, the jackal proud and tight. In 
search of you I feel my way though the slowest heaving night. Whatever 
fear invents, I swear it make no sense. I reach out through the border fence.
Come down, come talk to me. In the swirling, curling storm of desire 
unuttered words hold fast. With reptile tongue, the lightning lashes towers 
built to last. Darkness creeps in like a thief and offers no relief. Why 
are you shaking like a leaf. Come on, come talk to me. Ah please talk to me.
Won't you please talk to me. We can unlock this misery. Come on, come talk to me.
I did not come to steal. This all is so unreal. Can't you show me how you feel now.
Come on, come talk to me. Come talk to me. The earthly power sucks 
shadowed milk from sleepy tears undone. From nippled skin as smooth as 
silk the bugles blown as one. You lie there with your eyes half closed 
like there's no one there at all. There's a tension pulling on your face.
Come on, come talk to me. </div>
</div>
<div class="block2">
<div class="Pantera">Mouth For War</div>
<div class="text">
Revenge. I'm screaming revenge again. Wrong. I've been wrong for far too long.
Been constantly so frustrated. I've moved mountains with less. When I channel 
my hate to productive. I don't find it hard to impress. Bones in traction.
Hands break to hone raw energy. Bold and disastrous. My ears can't hear what you say to me.
Hold your mouth for the war. Use it for what it's for. Speak the truth about me.
Determined. Possessed. I feel a conquering will down inside me. Strength.
The strength of many to crush. Who might stop me. My strength is in number.
And my soul lies in every one. The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun.
There comes a time within everyone to close your eyes to what's real.
No comprehension to fail. I vacuum the wind for my sail. Can't be the rest.
Let others waste my time. Owning success is the bottom line. Like a knife into flesh.
After life is to death. Pulling and punching the rest of duration. NO ONE can piss on this determination.

	<div class="Tool">Lateralus</div>
	<div class="text">Black then white are all I see in my infancy. red and yellow then came to be, 
reaching out to me. lets me see. As below, so above and beyond, I imagine.
drawn beyond the lines of reason. Push the envelope. Watch it bend.
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must
Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.
Black then white are all I see in my infancy. red and yellow then came to be, 
reaching out to me. lets me see there is so much more and beckons me to 
look through to these infinite possibilities. As below, so above and beyond, I imagine
drawn outside the lines of reason. Push the envelope. Watch it bend.
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.
Withering my intuition leaving opportunities behind.
Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.
Reaching out to embrace the random. Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.
I embrace my desire to, I embrace my desire to feel the rhythm, to feel connected
enough to step aside and weep like a widow. to feel inspired, to fathom the power,
to witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain, to swing on the spiral, to swing on the spiral,
to swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human.
With my feet upon the ground I lose myself between the sounds and open wide to suck it in.
I feel it move across my skin. I'm reaching up and reaching out. I'm reaching for 
the random or whatever will bewilder me. Whatever will bewilder me.
And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been.
We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been. Spiral out. Keep going...
